# KBC-The-Game
A semi-visual, menu-driven, game written using TurboC++, which simulates the popular quizzing show, "Kaun Benga Crorepati"("Who wants to be a millionare?") . 

The game accepts user-input through keyboard, and the questions as well as other information are presented on the screen. It is an OOP-based implementation, which has many features resembling the real-world quizzing show:

1. Timer: Questions are timed and user will lose the game if one runs down the clock.
2. Rewards: Questions carry certain points, which increase consecutively. As points/money value of a question increase, so does its difficulty.
3. Lifelines: User can take help from any of the four lifelines, which are quite helpful.
4. Admin features, including adding/modifying questions, etc.

# Instructions for use:
Download as zip and place all the contents in the bin folder of your TurboC++ installation. 

I hope you like the game! Feedback and improvements are welcome!
